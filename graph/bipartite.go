/*
IsBipartite returns true if a graph whose vertices we can divide into two sets
such that all edges connect a vertex in one set (colored red) with a vertex in the other set
(colored black). In other words, can the vertices of a given graph be assigned one of two colors
in such a way that no edge connects vertices of the same color?

For example, IMDB can be defined as a graph with movies and performers as vertices and
each line defining the adjacency list of edges connecting each movie to its performers.
The graph is bipartite â€” there are no edges connecting performers to performers or movies to movies.
