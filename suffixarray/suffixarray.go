/*
Package suffixarray provides substring search using suffix array â€” the abstraction of a sorted list of
suffix strings. The cost of comparing two suffixes may be proportional to the length of the suffixes
in the case when their common prefix is very long, but most comparisons in typical applications involve
only a few characters. If so, the running time of the suffix sort is linearithmic.
If all the characters are equal, the sort examines every character in each suffix and thus takes
quadratic time.

LongestRepeatedSubstring returns the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string.
The idea is to make an array of the n suffixes (the substrings starting at each position and
going to the end), and then sort this array. Every substring appears somewhere as a prefix of one
of the suffixes in the array. After sorting, the longest repeated substrings will appear in adjacent
positions in the array. Thus, we can make a single pass through the sorted array, keeping track of
the longest matching prefixes between adjacent strings.
