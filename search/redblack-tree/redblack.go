/*
Package redblack implements a red-black binary search tree (BST) using recursive approach which is limited to a stack size.
BST is a binary tree where key in a node is larger than the keys in all its left children and
smaller than the keys in right children. New nodes are attached at the bottom of the tree.

Red-black tree encodes 2-3 tree with standard BST (2-nodes).
A 2-3 tree contains 2-nodes (1 key, 2 links) or 3-nodes (2 keys, 3 links) whose
left link has smaller keys, a middle link has keys in between, a right link has larger keys.

A red link binds together two standard nodes to represent a 3-node.
A black link binds together the 2-3 tree.
Red links lean left.
No node has two red links connected to it.
Every path from the root has the same number of black links (black height) â€” perfect black balance.

Such representation allows to use Get method from standard BST (lg n) and
the efficient (lg n) insertion-balancing method from 2-3 trees.

This implementation allows right-leaning red links or two red links in a row during an operation,
but it always corrects these conditions before completion using rotation.

After insertion perform balancing operations on the way up the tree:

	rotate left if the right child is red and the left child is black
	rotate right if both the left child and its left child are red
	flip colors if both children are red
