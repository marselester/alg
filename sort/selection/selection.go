/*
Package selection implements selection sort algorithm.
First, it finds the smallest item in the array and exchanges it with the first entry.
Then, it finds the next smallest item and exchanges it with the second entry.

Selection sort uses nÂ²/2 compares and n exchanges to sort an array of length n.
The number of exchanges is a linear function of the array length.

Running time is insensitive to initial order in the input array: it takes about as
long to sort a randomly-ordered array and array that is already ordered.

		// and are not examined again.
		for j := i + 1; j < len(a); j++ {
